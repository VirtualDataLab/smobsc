How to contribute
=================

If you want to contribute to the documentation, access the "docs" directory
in the repository: https://github.com/VirtualDataLab/smobsc or simply click
the "edit on github" button on the top of this page. In the docs directory
you will find an index.rst file. This is basically where you see the main
structure of the documentation with all the headers, subheaders etc.
If you want to link to a new section, you have to add it under toctree.
When building the documentation sphinx will go through the sections under
toctree and look for .rst files with the same names in the docs directory.
