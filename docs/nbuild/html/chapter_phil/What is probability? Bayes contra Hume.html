<h1>1.3. What is probability?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-probability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When we talk about probability, we are talking about a concept that is
omnipresent in our life – from thinking about all the probabilities you have
after finishing your work or the most basic of all probability examples, the
‘mother of probability’, gambling. The concept of probability is even more
fundamental when we take a look at how we understand science and approach all
parts of statistical methodology. Yet most of the time students cringe when
the word probability is spoken.</p>
<p>To be fair, almost everyone´s ability to estimate probabilities in real life
decision-making is very limited at best (<a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`Fhaner, 1977`_</span></a>) because we seem to be
prone to deterministic instead of probabilistic causations (<a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">`Frosch &amp;
Johnson-Laird, 2011`_</span></a>). This makes it even more important to spend some time
with this concept. If we are that bad at estimating probabilities in our
everyday life, we should at least get a better understanding of how we deal with
it in science. In this chapter, we will have a look at where our idea of
probability comes from, along with its two points of view – the so called
‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ probability – that are still debated in psychology
(<a href="#id5"><span class="problematic" id="id6">`Benjamin et al. 2018`_</span></a>; <a href="#id7"><span class="problematic" id="id8">`Dienes, 2011`_</span></a>; <a href="#id9"><span class="problematic" id="id10">`Howard, Maxwell, &amp; Fleming, 2000`_</span></a>;
<a href="#id11"><span class="problematic" id="id12">`Taper &amp; Lele, 2010`_</span></a>). We will try to grasp the concepts in this chapter,
since much of classical statistical tests will be explained later – so
we’ll try to use as few formulas as possible. Before we have a look at the
two opposing schools of probability, let´s have a look at the history and
maybe some reasons why one school was dominant in psychology for a long time.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-brief-history-of-gambling-and-egos">
<h2>1.3.1. A brief history of gambling and egos<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history-of-gambling-and-egos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>While we can find thoughts and solutions on probability from great names such
as Galileo and other scientists, the notion that probability has a quantitative
value between 0 and 1 - and with this forming our contemporary
understanding of probability, emerged somewhere in the middle of the 17th
century with the work of Pascal and Fermat (<a href="#id13"><span class="problematic" id="id14">`Galavotti, 2015`_</span></a>). The reason why
these two came up with new ideas on probability was more mundane than you
might think – it was gambling. According to <a href="#id15"><span class="problematic" id="id16">`Hacking (1975)`_</span></a> Pascal was
asked by the Chevalier de Méré from the court of Louis XIV to solve
‘problems about games of chance’ (<a href="#id17"><span class="problematic" id="id18">`Hacking, 1975`_</span></a>, p. 57) – namely
gambling – such as
fair chances in dice tosses and how players should divide the stake when a game
got interrupted. Pascal and Fermat had the idea that their concept of
probability could not only be used to solve gambling problems but could also be
used as a general model for reasoning under uncertainty. <a href="#id19"><span class="problematic" id="id20">`Hacking (1975)`_</span></a> puts
it quite frankly into the words ‘On the one side it [probability] is
statistical, concerning itself with stochastic laws of chance processes. On the
other side it is epistemological, dedicated to assessing reasonable degrees of
belief in propositions quite devoid of statistical background’ (p.12). Et
voilà, we had the birth of our modern understanding of probability and with
it the problem that we have a possible epistemic (belief or subjective) and an
empirical (frequencies or objective) interpretation of it.</p>
<p>For some time having two sides of a coin was not that much of a problem and
both possible interpretations coexisted. You will find all kinds of important
work on probability from all the names you can find in a typical textbook on
statistics – from Huygens to the Bernoullli family, Poisson, Gauss, Borel,
Markov to Kolmogorov who in 1933 showed that the mathematical results of
probability follow a basic set of axioms (<a href="#id21"><span class="problematic" id="id22">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>; <a href="#id23"><span class="problematic" id="id24">`Galavotti, 2015`_</span></a>).
But a few names stand out in this history of probability – Bayes, Laplace,
Fisher, Neyman and Pearson - because they are basic to our understanding of
probability in statistics and its opposing school, so let´s zoom in on them.</p>
<p>Thomas Bayes (1702-1761) was a minister and a member of the Royal Society with
only one publication under his name during his lifetime. He became the name
giver of the ‘Bayesian school’ or the subjective probability when his
friend Richard Price published a manuscript of his after his death. The
manuscript was on the problem of how one may obtain the probability of a
hypothesis given some data – something we would later call the Bayes’
theorem. This
concept was as simple as it was beautiful – We modify our opinion with
objective information: Initial beliefs + recent objective data = new and
improved belief (<a href="#id25"><span class="problematic" id="id26">`McGrayne, 2011`_</span></a>). We will have a closer look at this theorem
later in this chapter.</p>
<p>Bayes’ ideas were picked up by Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749-1827) in the early
19th century. Laplace was a probabilist and even referred to as the “Newton
of France” for his work in physics and astronomy. In his lifetime he came up
with two theories of probability that showed more or less the same results with
very large samples (<a href="#id27"><span class="problematic" id="id28">`Galavotti, 2015`_</span></a>). Just on a quick side note – Laplace
despised gambling.</p>
<p>Times changed; politics as well as personal animosities played their part as
much as a shift in the idea what ‘science’ could do, and with it crashed
the idea that there is a balance between subjective beliefs and objective
frequencies. The new natural science wanted a ‘route to certain knowledge’,
and how could this be subjective in any way? This led to scientists treating
the two points of view in probability as diametrical (<a href="#id29"><span class="problematic" id="id30">`McGrayne, 2011`_</span></a>).
Soon mathematicians should take over the field of probability, bringing with
them the frequentist approach or objective probability and most terms, concepts
and techniques we use in statistics today (<a href="#id31"><span class="problematic" id="id32">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>).</p>
<p>The most dominant name in this upcoming approach would become Sir Ronald Fisher
(1890-1962), a geneticist, who coined the terms ‘null hypothesis’
and ‘significance’ (<a href="#id33"><span class="problematic" id="id34">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>). Though often deemed the originator of the
tradition of using p &lt; .05 as an arbitrary level to judge results as
statistically significant, Fisher (1926, p. 85) was open in suggesting that
each researcher should select a threshold in relation to the specific study.
As a matter of fact, Gigerenzer et al. (<a href="#id35"><span class="problematic" id="id36">`Gigerenzer, 2004`_</span></a>; p. 392)
suggest that “Fisher thought that using a routine 5% level of significance
indicated lack of statistical thinking”.
Fisher, after working for years on
randomization, sampling theory, experimental designs, tests of significance and
analysis of variance, published a revolutionary manual for
non-statisticians – Statistical Methods for Research Workers (<a href="#id37"><span class="problematic" id="id38">`Fisher,
1925`_</span></a>). This manual was a game changer and helped to turn the frequentist
approach into the state of the art for years to come.</p>
<p>Aside from (or maybe because of) his smart mind, Fisher was in a constant
ad-hominem feud with his colleagues, especially Karl Pearson (1857-1936) – a
British mathematician and biostatistician and the name-giver
of the Pearson correlation, his son Egon
Pearson (1895-1980), a statistician, and his colleague Jerzy Neyman
(1894-1981), a mathematician (<a href="#id39"><span class="problematic" id="id40">`McGrayne, 2011`_</span></a>). The last two developed the
ideas of hypothesis testing and statistical inference (<a href="#id41"><span class="problematic" id="id42">`Pearson &amp; Neyman, 1928`_</span></a>;
<a href="#id43"><span class="problematic" id="id44">`Neyman &amp; Pearson 1933`_</span></a>). Even though Pearson and Neyman had a heated and
ongoing feud with Fisher, the three of them still became the ‘godfathers’
of the so called <em>objective probability</em> approach and with it the still most
ubiquitous method in the social and behavioral sciences - null hypothesis
significance testing (NHST; <a href="#id45"><span class="problematic" id="id46">`Cumming et al., 2007`_</span></a>, <a href="#id47"><span class="problematic" id="id48">`Perezgonzalez, 2015`_</span></a>).
Now that we have an idea on the who is who of probability, let´s go and have a
look at the two schools of thought in detail. We will have a look at their
logic and their basic concepts. Let us begin with the objective probability.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="objective-probability">
<h2>1.3.2. Objective probability<a class="headerlink" href="#objective-probability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The so called objective probability or frequentism is still the most common
logic in the social and behavioral sciences, from statistics courses to most
journals in this field. There are two classical approaches to frequentism –
Fisher significance testing and Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing. Table 1
(taken from <a href="#id49"><span class="problematic" id="id50">`Kline, 2013`_</span></a>, p. 68) shows you the difference between the two,
and that most frequentists today follow the Neyman-Pearson logic, which most
people now know by the name null hypothesis testing (NHST). As you can see in
the table, the Neyman-Pearson logic is in reality a hybrid of Fisher´s ideas
and terms he coined and the hypothesis testing ideas of Neyman and Pearson
(<a href="#id51"><span class="problematic" id="id52">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>). In this part, we will have a look at the logic and
assumptions of these steps in NHST.</p>

<div class="section" id="frequencies-and-infinity">
<h3>Frequencies and infinity!<a class="headerlink" href="#frequencies-and-infinity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The objective probability approach follows the idea that the probability of
something happening is not in the mind, or a subjective belief, but rather
objectively exists in the real world and needs to be discovered (<a href="#id53"><span class="problematic" id="id54">`Dienes,
2008`_</span></a>). A subjective interpretation of probability is not compatible with
science (<a href="#id55"><span class="problematic" id="id56">`Popper, 2013`_</span></a>).</p>
<p>The objective interpretation of probability is analyzed through a long-run
relative frequency (<a href="#id57"><span class="problematic" id="id58">`von Mises, 1957`_</span></a>)– ‘wherein probability is the
relative frequency of a given attribute, that can be observed in the initial
part of
an indefinite sequence of repeatable events’ (<a href="#id59"><span class="problematic" id="id60">`Galavotti, 2015`_</span></a>, p. 748).
What does that mean? The classical example is a coin toss – imagine you want
to know if a coin is fair, so chances are equal between heads and tails. You
flip it 10 times and it comes up with an unequal number of times between heads
and tails. Does that mean the coin is not fair? No, because it is possible that
a coin could show heads 3 out of 10 times. You would need an infinite
number of coin tosses to determine exactly, whether the coin is fair – any
number of repetitions smaller than infinity will always be an approximation.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly you now realize that the idea of an infinite number of
observations would be impossible, and that this is an idealization of what is
actually possible. So how can we manage this problem, since most of us do not
have the time for an infinite number of observations? Neyman-Pearson came up with
an idea for that problem – setting up a set of decision rules for accepting and
rejecting a hypothesis so that in the long run we will often not be wrong
(<a href="#id61"><span class="problematic" id="id62">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="let-s-come-up-with-a-hypothesis-and-a-rejection-rule">
<h3>Let´s come up with a hypothesis (and a rejection rule)<a class="headerlink" href="#let-s-come-up-with-a-hypothesis-and-a-rejection-rule" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This set of decision rules is quite strict (see Table 1 to refresh the rule
set) and we will have a look at it from the beginning. The first thing we need
to do is set up two hypotheses. The first one is the null hypothesis
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span>) and the second one is the alternative hypothesis (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_1\)</span>).</p>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span> are most commonly either nil hypotheses – where the value is
0 - or point hypotheses with a numerical value of a parameter. You would use
the nil hypothesis when the parameter is unknown, for example in a new field
of research. When you have an idea that the parameter will be some specific
value other than zero, you would use the point hypothesis.</p>
<p>The H1 is a range hypothesis that can be either non-directional (two-tailed),
predicting any result that is not included in the H0, or directional
(one-tailed), predicting a value that is smaller or greater than the one
included in H0. To give you an idea, here is an example: Given that</p>
<p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0 = 0\)</span>, a non-directional <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_1\)</span> would be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_1 \neq 0\)</span> and
a directional <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_1\)</span> would either be <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_1 &lt; 0\)</span> or  <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_1 &gt; 0\)</span>.
All this is to be specified before the data is collected.</p>
<p>Now we need a line of rejection and this is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> or the level of
significance which is set at 0.05 (remember - the term significance and the
convention of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> were Fisher`s ideas) by most conventions in
the social and behavioral sciences. In a given observation we can now calculate
the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value, and if this is below <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span>, we would speak
of statistical significance. Sometimes people confuse <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span>
and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> (<a href="#id63"><span class="problematic" id="id64">`Hubbard, Bayarri, Berk, &amp; Carlton, 2003`_</span></a>). <a href="#id65"><span class="problematic" id="id66">`Gigerenzer
(1993)`_</span></a> helps us to differentiate these two by referring to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> as the
exact level of significance in the observation and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> is the line
that gives us the long-run probability error.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that if the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span> is true, and we would have an
infinite number of observations, in the long run, we would falsely reject the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span>. I told you above, it is a system of decision that will help us
to minimize errors in the long run. So let us have a look at the two possible
types of errors here.</p>

<h3>It is about the errors…long term errors<a class="headerlink" href="#it-is-about-the-errors-long-term-errors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We have met <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> but there is another important possible long-term
error – <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>. Remember, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> is the long-term probability
error that says when <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> there is a 5% long-term error
chance to reject the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(H_0\)</span> when it is true. This type of error is called
the Type I error. In the binary thinking of accepting or rejecting a
hypothesis, there must be a second possible error – accepting the null
hypothesis
when it is in false. This type of error is called Type II error or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>. We can put this into a nice little ‘formula’: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha
= P(\text{rejecting}\ H_0 | H_0\ \text{is true})\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta =
P(\text{accepting}\
H_0 | H_0\ \text{is false})\)</span>.</p>
<p>In the frequentist approach, you should control for both types of long-term
errors and decide on an acceptable level for both. Since Fisher suggested the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha = 0.05\)</span> most people and journals tend to blindly follow this
rule. <a href="#id67"><span class="problematic" id="id68">`Aguinis et al. (2010)`_</span></a> advise caution with that and to reflect on the
desired relative seriousness of the Type I vs. Type II error, depending on your
research. <a href="#id69"><span class="problematic" id="id70">`Neyman (1953)`_</span></a> suggested <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = 0.20\)</span> as the highest
possible value for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span>, and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta = \alpha\)</span> as its lower
floor. So how do we control for the Type II error? You need to</p>
<p>1. estimate the effect size that matches your statistical method - e.g.
Cohens-<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(d\)</span> (<a href="#id71"><span class="problematic" id="id72">`Cohen, 1977`_</span></a>) when looking for mean differences – and
which you think would be relevant in real life, given your theory is true and
2. do a prospective (a priori) power calculation.</p>
<p>Power is essentially <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1 - \beta\)</span>. So if you decide you want to keep
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\beta\)</span> at .05 you need a power of 0.95. There are free calculators and
programs like G*Power (<a href="#id73"><span class="problematic" id="id74">`Faul, Erdfelder, Buchner, &amp; Lang, 2009`_</span></a>; <a href="#id75"><span class="problematic" id="id76">`Faul,
Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, 2007`_</span></a>) as well as good practical papers (e.g.
<a href="#id77"><span class="problematic" id="id78">`Howell, 2012`_</span></a>; <a href="#id79"><span class="problematic" id="id80">`Murphy &amp; Myors, 2014`_</span></a>) out there to help you calculate
power. This will be discussed more in-depth in a later section of this volume.
Interestingly, many researchers seem to spend a lot of thought on the Type I
error but almost seem to ignore the possible Type II error (<a href="#id81"><span class="problematic" id="id82">`Brock, 2003`_</span></a>;
<a href="#id83"><span class="problematic" id="id84">`Kline, 2013`_</span></a>; <a href="#id85"><span class="problematic" id="id86">`Sedlmeier &amp; Gigerenzer, 1989`_</span></a>). Unfortunately, this is not
the only problematic thing that occurs a lot – there are some serious
misconceptions about the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value as well.</p>

<h3>Some more errors but mostly not planned ones.<a class="headerlink" href="#some-more-errors-but-mostly-not-planned-ones" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value is essential to most statistical tests in NHST. It is the
probability (where the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value comes from) of witnessing
the observed result or even a more extreme value if the null hypothesis is
true (see <a href="#id87"><span class="problematic" id="id88">`Hubbard and Lindsay, 2008`_</span></a>; <a href="#id89"><span class="problematic" id="id90">`Kline, 2013`_</span></a>). Unfortunately, many
psychologists – from students to professors - often have some misconceptions
about the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value (<a href="#id91"><span class="problematic" id="id92">`Badenes-Ribera, Frias-Navarro, Iotti,
Bonilla-Campos, &amp; Longobardi, 2016`_</span></a>; <a href="#id93"><span class="problematic" id="id94">`Badenes-Ribera, Frias-Navarro,
Monterde-i-Bort, &amp; Pascual-Soler, 2015`_</span></a>; <a href="#id95"><span class="problematic" id="id96">`Haller &amp; Krauss, 2002`_</span></a>, <a href="#id97"><span class="problematic" id="id98">`Oakes,
1986`_</span></a>). This is so common that we should have a close look at this so that you
will not make these mistakes in your career. <a href="#id99"><span class="problematic" id="id100">`Badenes-Ribera et al. (2016)`_</span></a> name
the most common misconceptions: the ‘inverse probability fallacy’, the
‘effect size fallacy’, the ‘clinical or practical significance fallacy’,
the ‘replication fallcy’ and <a href="#id101"><span class="problematic" id="id102">`Verdam, Ort, &amp; Sprangers (2013)`_</span></a> expand this by
adding the ‘proof fallacy’.</p>
<p><em>The inverse probability fallacy</em> is the belief that the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value tells
us the probability of the theory is true given the data - when really it is the
other way around, and not at all interchangeable. Coming back to a
basic formula - the fallacy here is to think that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\text{theory} |
\text{data})\)</span> while in truth it is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P( \text{data} |\text{theory})\)</span> and
one cannot infer the probability of one of these two just by knowing the
inverse variant.</p>
<p><a href="#id103"><span class="problematic" id="id104">`Dienes (2011)`_</span></a> fills this theoretical approach with a rather bloody and
graphic example which should make this seizable for you: The probability of
being dead given that a shark has bitten off one`s head - or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\text{dead}|\text{head bitten off by shark})\)</span> - is 1. The probability
of a head bitten off by a shark given one is dead - or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\text{head
bitten off by a shark}|\text{dead})\)</span> – is almost 0 since most people die of
other causes. Therefore, one should not mistake
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\text{data}|\text{theory})\)</span> with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\text{theory}|\text{data})\)</span>.</p>
<p><em>The effect size fallacy</em> is the false belief that the smaller the
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value, the larger is the effect (<a href="#id105"><span class="problematic" id="id106">`Gliner, Vaske, &amp; Morgan, 2001`_</span></a>).
Yet the effect size is not determined by the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value but by its
appropriate
statistic and the confidence interval (<a href="#id107"><span class="problematic" id="id108">`Cumming 2012`_</span></a>; <a href="#id109"><span class="problematic" id="id110">`Kline, 2013`_</span></a>). Simply
spoken, the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value by itself gives you very little information about
the effect size.</p>
<p><em>The clinical or practical significance fallacy</em> is closely related to the
effect size fallacy because it links a statistically significant effect with
the idea that it is an important effect (<a href="#id111"><span class="problematic" id="id112">`Nickerson, 2000`_</span></a>). The truth is
that a statistically significant effect can be without any clinical or
practical importance. Just imagine two samples of one million people each are
measured in height and the statistical test shows that they have a
statistically significant difference in height. But in real life, they have a
mean-difference of one millimeter – no one would say that a one millimeter
height difference has any practical importance. <a href="#id113"><span class="problematic" id="id114">`Kirk (1996)`_</span></a> states that
the clinical or practical importance of results should be described by an
expert in the field, not presented by a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value.</p>
<p><em>The replication fallacy</em> is the false belief that the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value gives
you an exact idea about the replicability of the results. This fallacy even has
people mistakenly thinking that the complement of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span> (i.e.
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1-p\)</span>) tells you the probability of finding statistically significant
results in a replication study (<a href="#id115"><span class="problematic" id="id116">`Carver, 1978`_</span></a>). Unfortunately ‘any
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value gives only very vague information about what is likely to
happen on
replication, and any single <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-value could easily have been quite
different, simply because of sampling variety` (<a href="#id117"><span class="problematic" id="id118">`Cumming, 2008`_</span></a>, p. 286).</p>
<p><em>The proof fallacy</em> is the fallacy to think that when the null hypothesis is
rejected, it proves that the alternative hypothesis is true because there can
be possible alternative explanations. Furthermore, it is also a fallacy to
think when the null hypothesis is not rejected, it proves that the alternative
hypothesis is false because this just might be a consequence of statistical
power (see <a href="#id119"><span class="problematic" id="id120">`Verdam et al., 2014`_</span></a>).</p>

<h3>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you can see, the school of objective probability or frequentism is not
without some serious pitfalls and yet it is still the most dominant framework
used in the social and behavioral sciences. It has its own logic that
unfortunately is so often misunderstood that some researchers go so far as to
call for an abandonment of significance testing (e.g. <a href="#id121"><span class="problematic" id="id122">`Harlow, Mulaik, Steiger,
2016`_</span></a>; <a href="#id123"><span class="problematic" id="id124">`Kline, 2013`_</span></a>). Other authors (e.g. <a href="#id125"><span class="problematic" id="id126">`Cummings, 2013`_</span></a>) or the
APA manual (<a href="#id127"><span class="problematic" id="id128">`APA, 2010`_</span></a>) demand the reporting of confidence intervals instead
of or in addition to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(p\)</span>-values. Strangely, this is what Neyman often
did. He rarely used hypothesis testing in his own research but most of the
time reported confidence limits around the estimates of his model parameters
(<a href="#id129"><span class="problematic" id="id130">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>). <a href="#id131"><span class="problematic" id="id132">`Oakes (1986)`_</span></a> muses that some of the confusion in
frequentism is due to fact that many researchers unknowingly have a subjective
probability or Bayesian understanding of research. So it is time to see have a
look at this approach and see if you are one of them.</p>

<h3>Introduction and the Bayes theorem<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction-and-the-bayes-theorem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Remember that objective probability ‘only’ tells us something about
inferences about long-run frequencies and their possible error rate but not
about the probability of a hypothesis being right. But most people want to have
some information on that as well. Just imagine you are leaving your apartment but
before you do that, you look out the window and think ‘What are the odds it
might rain today?’. Would you grab an umbrella or not? You might base your
decision on how you high you estimate the probability of rain to be on this
day. Objective probability cannot help you in this case, because this is a
single event, not a long-run frequency. The moment you make a decision thinking
‘I think it may rain today, I’d better take an umbrella with me’, you are
in the realm of subjective probability.</p>
<p>Subjective probability is the degree of belief you have in a hypothesis
(<a href="#id133"><span class="problematic" id="id134">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>). Of course it gets a little more complicated than that when
we are talking about how to implement subjective probability into a statistical
tool but the essence stays the same. The most basic notion here, before we get
to the details, is that you have an inkling of the probability of a hypothesis.
You might check some sources, collect some data – in our example, you
might check the Weather Channel – but at the end of day, you have to decide
if you think the probability of rain is high enough to take an umbrella with
you.</p>
<p>Because most people are not really good at updating their personal beliefs in
the light of new information (<a href="#id135"><span class="problematic" id="id136">`Sutherland, 1994`_</span></a>), we have to come up with a
system that helps us to be more scientific. At this point we come back to
Bayes and his friend Price who presented his work posthumously to the Royal
Society. In this work, Bayes describes the fundamental logic to subjective
probability – the Bayes` theorem (<a href="#id137"><span class="problematic" id="id138">`Bayes &amp; Price, 1763`_</span></a>):</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(H|D) = P(D|H) \cdot \frac{P(H)}{P(D)}\]</div>
<p>Now, let us pick this apart:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(H|D)\)</span> is the posterior, the probability of a hypothesis given some</li>
</ul>
<p>data
- <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(D|H)\)</span> is the likelihood or the probability of obtaining the data
given your hypothesis
- <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(H)\)</span> is the prior, your belief about the hypothesis before you start
collecting data
- <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(D)\)</span> is the evidence or the data</p>
<p>We will take a closer look at these components in a moment, but first some more
general ideas: if you want to compare hypotheses given the same data, P(D)
would be constant and you switch the formula above to:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(H|D) \propto P(D|H) \cdot  P(H)\]</div>
<p>Your posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the prior – and this
is the basic tenet of Bayesian statistics. It simply tells you that you will
update the prior probability of your hypothesis when you have some data and
you will form a new conclusion – the posterior. In real human words this
means – from a Bayesian point of view, your scientific inference is updating
your beliefs in a hypothesis when you have some new data (<a href="#id139"><span class="problematic" id="id140">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>).
Before we get a more detailed look at some important concepts, let us make a
short excursion into the philosophy of science and give these new concepts some
time to settle in your mind. Our excursion should make it clearer why so
many scientists had a hard time with subjective probability, even when most of
us are using it intuitively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-philosophical-excursion-to-popper-hume">
<h3>A philosophical excursion to Popper &amp; Hume<a class="headerlink" href="#a-philosophical-excursion-to-popper-hume" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you think about the logic of the Bayesian approach, it is pretty close to
inductive thinking – the process to come up with rules from observations. Let
us take the famous swan argument here as an example. You see one white
swan; and another one; and another one; and so on, and you come to the
inductive conclusion that all swans are white. You have no guarantee that this
rule is true but due to your observations it seems plausible to you. You can do
the same thought experiment with the thought that you will wake up the next
morning or that the sun will rise. The school of thought that used inductive
thinking was called positivism and this thinking had two famous opponents –
David Hume (1711-1776) and Sir Karl Popper (1902-1994).</p>
<p>David Hume was a Scottish philosopher who argued that we should never reason
from experience (seeing a lot of white swans) about situations we have not
experienced yet (seeing a swan of a different color). You might say that in
your experience the probability increases when you see tons of white swans that
the next one will be white too. Hume would disagree with that because it does
not follow logically. Take the second thought experiment – you waking up
in the morning. Every day you wake up in the morning and this experience should
increase the probability of you waking up tomorrow – inductively speaking.
Now, add age to the equation and you see at one point, it becomes less
likely that you will wake up the next morning. Hume points out that ‘no
matter how often induction has worked in the past, there is no reason to think
it will work ever again. Not unless you already assume induction, that is’
(<a href="#id141"><span class="problematic" id="id142">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>, p.5). A historical fun fact that is closely related to the
swan argument, comes from the time that the British went to Australia. Guess
what they found? Of course, they found black swans.</p>
<p>The second interesting mind here is Karl Popper, who essentially started the
research field of philosophy of science by attempting to formalize what
distinguishes science from non-science. Popper
argued against positivism and with it inductive thinking. His alternative philosophy
was <em>fallibilism</em>. In a nutshell (because <a href="#id143"><span class="problematic" id="id144">`Chapter 1.2`_</span></a> is dealing with this in
a much deeper way): You cannot verify a theory - say a theory is true;
you can only falsify theory. In this, Popper agreed with Hume’s pessimism on
induction (e.g. <a href="#id145"><span class="problematic" id="id146">`Popper, 1934`_</span></a>). For him a theory would in a best case scenario
always be a guess, nothing more.</p>
<p>As [Popper would later explain](<a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO2az5Eb3H0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZO2az5Eb3H0</a>),
a major contributor to his theory was a series of events that occured in his youth.
On one hand, the young Popper admired how science had resolved the conflict between
Newtonian Mechanics, and Einstein’s Theory of Relativity.
In 1919, a [daring experiment](<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_29,_1919</a>)
brought forceful support for Einstein’s side. Einstein’s theory had entailed
that the gravitational pull of the sun should shift the visible appearance of
remote stars around its disc - occluded by the eclipse of 1919 - would shift by
a precise amount. The amount predicted by Einstein was slightly larger than that
predicted by Newtonian physics. When the results arrived, Einstein’s predictions
were found to have withstood this test: Relativity was found to <em>not</em> conflict
with empirical results. The test of Einstein’s theory had not rejected, and
thereby corroborate (as Popper would later call it), the theory. The similarities
to null hypothesis testing are evident.</p>
<p>In contrast, Popper was disappointed with a growing dogmatism he found
in his Marxist friends. They seemed disinterested in any contradictory evidence -
only confirmation was what concerned them. Observing how much more succesful -
epistemologically speaking - physics had been compared to Marxism, Popper suggested
the latter model - and thus <em>falsificationism</em> - as the ideal according to which
science should be judged: always aware of the impossibility of induction,
always open, even embracing, the potential for falsification.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, these two, especially Karl Popper, had a huge influence on
how people understood science in the 20th century, and why the school of
objective probability was so dominant for a long time. Of course there is more
to the story – from politics to history (for an in-depth look see <a href="#id147"><span class="problematic" id="id148">`McGrayne,
2011`_</span></a>) – but you have an idea why it took the school of subjective
probability and with it the Bayesian approach for inductive reasoning so long to
be back in the game. Now it is time for us to take a deeper look into the
Bayesian ideas and its concepts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-prior">
<h3>The prior<a class="headerlink" href="#the-prior" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let us start at the beginning – the prior or for the formula aficionados -
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(H)\)</span>. Remember, the prior is your belief about the hypothesis before
you start collecting data. How can we address this? First we have to assign a
number between 0 and 1. Zero means there is no chance that the hypothesis is
true and one means you are certain it is true. If you ask yourself how you
should deal with all the possibilities between 0 and 1, the answer you will
get from most people who have something to do with Bayes will be – How much
money would you be willing to bet on your statement? This is a rather unclear
answer so let us see how we can establish a prior in a more formal matter.</p>
<p>What we need is a distribution for the prior. First ask yourself if you have
any previous information on the matter. This information may vary - from a
special subjective belief to previous studies. If there is no information, we
can use a ‘uniform prior’ or ‘uninformed prior’ with a uniform
distribution where all values are equally likely. Do you have some previous
information – let us say the distribution of the construct intelligence? You
know that the
distribution is a normal distribution with mean of 100 and a standard deviation
of 15. So you could use this as your prior. Sometimes people use different
priors to see how robust their posterior distribution is after the data.
Some just use uninformed prior so that the likelihood (we will come to that one
soon) will dominate completely – these researchers are called ‘objective
Bayesians’ (<a href="#id149"><span class="problematic" id="id150">`Dienes, 2008`_</span></a>).</p>
<p>The concept of the prior is hard to grasp in the beginning and could be a big
obstacle for some people to try Bayesian methods. And of course, there are a
lot of debates about possible priors (e.g. <a href="#id151"><span class="problematic" id="id152">`Gelman, 2009`_</span></a>; <a href="#id153"><span class="problematic" id="id154">`Kruschke,
2010`_</span></a>; <a href="#id155"><span class="problematic" id="id156">`van de Schoot et al. 2014`_</span></a>; <a href="#id157"><span class="problematic" id="id158">`Vanpaemel, 2010`_</span></a>; <a href="#id159"><span class="problematic" id="id160">`Winkler, 1967`_</span></a>)
because this is the most subjective part of this school of thought. If one
person chooses a prior, it does not mean another person would agree with that
prior. I hope you get the idea of the prior here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="likelihood">
<h3>Likelihood<a class="headerlink" href="#likelihood" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Now that we know more about the prior <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(H)\)</span> , let us now talk about the
second part – likelihood <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(D|H)\)</span>. The likelihood contains the
information about the parameters given the data. This means that the support
for our hypothesis is provided by our data by a likelihood distribution with
the possible values (<a href="#id161"><span class="problematic" id="id162">`van de Schoot et al., 2014`_</span></a>). Remember the Bayes´
theorem  from above? The posterior is proportional to the likelihood times the
prior or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(H|D) \propto P(D|H) · P(H)\)</span>. The likelihood connects the
prior to the posterior so all information that is relevant to inference from
the data is provided by the likelihood (<a href="#id163"><span class="problematic" id="id164">`Birnbaum, 1962`_</span></a>). We will have a
likelihood distribution that is combined with the prior distribution or
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(D|H) · P(H)\)</span> to obtain our posterior distribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(H|D)\)</span>.
What does that exactly mean?</p>
<p>Go back to your idea of previous information on your question. If you had no
information and you were using a non-informative prior with a uniform
distribution, all results would be equally possible. If you combine this with the
likelihood, then it will show you exactly the posterior distribution because
every probability in the prior was the same. But if you have some information
and you are using an informed prior with a distribution of your choice, the
likelihood will be combined with that information to form a posterior
distribution. In the second case it means that the hypothesis with the greatest
support from the data – the greatest likelihood – might differ from the highest
posterior probability distribution. Also, if you have a lot of data the
influence of the prior becomes less important to the posterior distribution
(<cite>Dienes, 2008</cite>). Let us have a look at this with an example.</p>
<p>Imagine you would be interested in the number of rainy days in January and you
have no idea about rain (uninformed prior). You would collect data by looking
out the window (data and likelihood), you would come up with an idea
about how many days it would rain (posterior) and maybe use that knowledge next
year in January as a new and slightly informed prior. Or in a second case, you
have the belief that it rains mostly when it is grey and cloudy
(informed prior). Most January days in Central Europe are grey and cloudy so
according to your belief, it should rain a lot. Once again you are collecting
data by looking out your window (data and likelihood) and let us assume, it
does not rain much but it is grey and cloudy, and you must update your
information. But still the informed prior that it should rain on days that are
grey and cloudy has an influence on your posterior. If you had collected tons of
data on grey and cloudy days, and at the same time there is little chance of
rain, the data would provide much more information on your posterior, your new
belief about rainy and cloudy days, than your prior, your initial belief.
Once again you can imagine why the prior is so important (and debated, as
mentioned above) because if the prior is misspecified, the posterior results
are affected due to the compromise between likelihood and prior (<a href="#id165"><span class="problematic" id="id166">`van de Schoot
et al, 2014`_</span></a>). Now that we have an idea of how prior and likelihood interact,
we need to have a look at the last piece of the puzzle – the posterior
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(H|D)\)</span>. The posterior will be a distribution that is a combination of
prior distribution and likelihood distribution and represents your updated
belief. The posterior shows you an explicit distribution of the probability of
each possible value (<a href="#id167"><span class="problematic" id="id168">`Kruschke, Aguinis, &amp; Joo, 2012`_</span></a>). Now you could use
your updated belief as a new prior and repeat the whole process to update your
knowledge once more.</p>

<h3>Conclusion Bayes<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-bayes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I guess this was a lot to think about so let us take a breath and revisit the
concepts. Using Bayesian methods and therefore the subjective probability
approach is a way to update your subjective beliefs by combining your belief
about a hypothesis and the evidence, and all this with distributions or
different probabilities of possible results. This is much more complex than a
possible black and white answer where you reject or do not reject a hypothesis.
But we have seen that the prior is a double edged sword. It helps us to use
previous knowledge (and often we have knowledge on things) but it can have an
influence on our results because our previous knowledge might be very wrong
and so we might choose a wrong prior. Given enough data this problem might not
be so relevant but still it has been opening up debates in science for quite
some time (e.g. <a href="#id169"><span class="problematic" id="id170">`Gelman, 2009`_</span></a>; <a href="#id171"><span class="problematic" id="id172">`Kruschke, 2010`_</span></a>; <a href="#id173"><span class="problematic" id="id174">`van de Schoot et al.
2014`_</span></a>; <a href="#id175"><span class="problematic" id="id176">`Vanpaemel, 2010`_</span></a>; <a href="#id177"><span class="problematic" id="id178">`Winkler, 1967`_</span></a>). Furthermore, the distributions
of posterior probabilities might give a more complex picture of reality but
often we are forced to make black and white decisions (decide if we want to
pay for a medication or not) because we have to act. It is a different approach
to probability and now you have heard of it as well. So let us end with some
final thoughts.</p>

<h2>1.3.4. Conclusion chapter<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion-chapter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At this point I hope you have a better understanding of two points of view of
probability that are common in the social and behavioral sciences. Of course
there is much more to it; more formulas, more mathematics, and different
statistical approaches but my goal was to give you a first idea of the concepts
that are at the basis of so many different methods in statistics. Both points
of view come with their own strengths, weaknesses and possible pitfalls.
I do not want to argue for one or against the other but my hope is that you
will understand that both points of view have a different aim, a different
inference, and are sensitive to different things. You should be aware of your
research question and the kind of probability that helps you to find an answer
to this question. Do you need a black and white answer using objective
probability or do you need a continuous distribution of posterior beliefs using
subjective probability? Both probabilities come with a huge toolbox of
applicable statistical methods (and some of them are discussed by my colleagues
in this volume) and many of those methods can be used with both approaches. So
chose your tool and scientific approach to each question you ask very careful
and aware of the alternatives. I wish you a pleasant journey into the wonderful
world of statistics.</p>
